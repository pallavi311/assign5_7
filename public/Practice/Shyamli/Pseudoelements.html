                The U.S. Southern Command on Tuesday said the missile destroyer Nitze conducted a “freedom of navigation” operation off Venezuela’s coast. 
                The Southern Command said the vessel sailed in an area outside Venezuela’s territorial waters - 
                which extend some 12 nautical miles from its coasts - but within an area the Venezuelan government “falsely claims to have control over.”
